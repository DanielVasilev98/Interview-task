# Interview-task
# Update
I've updated the code as you required(added more and smaller functions, some OOP, finished the battle part of the task and I tried to make as less code nests as possible, and I also separated the code in different .js files).
Also, I've noticed that if you pick a pokemon to go to battle, his opponent might have the same speed as the picked one, so I made it like the following: if both pokemons have same speed value the picked one hits first.(spotted this case in the last moment and it was to late to ask you how to proceed).
